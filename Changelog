v0.5.1 Packaging Fix
- Gemspec was referencing a missing file
- Behold: THREE DIGIT VERSION NUMBER. Serious business now!

v0.5 Raw, Son
- You can now initialize an instance from raw CLI output

v0.4 Mediainfo Respects Your Existing Customs
- Define String#shell_escape only if it is not already defined

v0.3 Mediainfo Is High Class
- Class instead of instance-level customization of mediainfo binary path. 
  Set Mediainfo.path = /path/to/binary if mediainfo is not in your shell 
  path.
- Instances retain the :last_command run. The API to rerun that command is 
  still private.
- Started defining custom Mediainfo exception classes and are now raising 
  Mediainfo::ExecutionError instead of RuntimeError if the system command 
  exits with anything other than 0.

v0.2 Escape from the Shell
- Added proper escaping for funky filenames. Thanks to Peter Vandenberk!
